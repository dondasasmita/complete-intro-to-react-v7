{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"description":""},"html":"<p>One last very cool trick that Jest has built into it: <a href=\"https://istanbul.js.org/\">Istanbul</a>. Istanbul (which is not <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vsQrKZcYtqg\">Constantinople</a>) is a tool which tells you <em>how much</em> of your code that you&#39;re covering with tests. Via an interactive viewer you can see what lines are and aren&#39;t covered. This used to be annoying to set up by Jest just does it for you.</p>\n<p>Add the following command to your npm scripts: <code>&quot;test:coverage&quot;: &quot;jest --coverage&quot;</code> and go ahead run <code>npm run test:coverage</code> and open the following file in your browser: <code>open coverage/lcov-report/index.html</code>.</p>\n<p>Here you can see the four files we&#39;ve written tests for. One file, <code>useBreedList</code> is missing a line of coverage (click on the file name to see that): it&#39;s the line of reading back from the cache. That actually is a pretty important thing to cover as it could be a source of bugs (cache might as well be French for software bug). This can help identify gaps in your testing coverage.</p>\n<p>Lastly, add <code>coverage/</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> since this shouldn&#39;t be checked in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>üèÅ <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/citr-v7-project/tree/master/testing\">Click here to see the state of the project up until now: testing</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n","slug":"istanbul","title":"Istanbul","section":"Testing","icon":"vial","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v7/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/16-testing/G-istanbul.md","nextSlug":"/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/testing/visual-studio-code-extension","prevSlug":"/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/testing/snapshots"}},"__N_SSG":true}
